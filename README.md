1. Every CSS for a project should be in it's own _.css_ file. Similarly, Every JS for a project should be in it's own _.js_ file.

2. Make new '_project(number).css_' file. [ex: '_project1.css_', '_project2.css_']. The file should be located in '_static/css/_' folder.

3. Similarly if you need a .js file make a '_project(number).js_' file in '_static/js/_' folder.

4. Every class and id in the project_div should be named "_project(number)_class_name_". [ex: '_.project1_neon_', '_.project1_header_', _#project1_header_ ].
